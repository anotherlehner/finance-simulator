# Financial Simulator

This is an exploratory project of my own for financial planning. It's also a playground for learning about and practicing the newer features of the JVM, which I use every day at work.

## Build and run

```
./gradlew build # compile the project

./gradlew run # will create an output.csv

python3 chart.py # creates a graph from the produced simulation data
```
